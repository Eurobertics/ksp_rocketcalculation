# Delta-V calculation for Kerbal Space Program (KSP)
This Excel sheet is a try to calculate the required delta-v to bring a rocket into space. It is designed for the game **Kerbal Space Program (KSP)** but it basics
are for real world rockets as well.
Be advised it is not free of mathematical inconsistency, this was created just for fun and to understand a bit more what the mathematical background of creating rockets is.
